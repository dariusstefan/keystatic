## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## CMS

This project exposes two CMS admin UIs:

- Keystatic is available through the existing Astro integration at `/keystatic/`.
- Decap CMS is served as static Astro assets from `public/admin/`, so it is available at `/admin/`.

The Decap configuration lives in `public/admin/config.yml` and targets the Starlight docs under `src/content/docs/docs`.

For local Decap editing, run the Decap proxy from the repo root, then start Astro:

```sh
npx decap-server
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321/admin/`.

Production Decap GitHub login requires an OAuth provider. If the site is not using Netlify Identity/Git Gateway, configure a GitHub OAuth proxy and set `backend.base_url` in `public/admin/config.yml`.
